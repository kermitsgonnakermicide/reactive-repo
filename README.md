#  Random Recipe Generator

Heyo! This project was a quick one (originally made for Reactive)

As the description says, this website uses an API to get **random recipes** from the internet for you to try.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **React 18**
- **Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS**

---

##  API

This project uses the **Spoonacular API** and relies on the following endpoints:

- `GET /recipes/random` — Fetch random recipes  
- `GET /recipes/{id}/information` — Get specific recipe details

---

##  How It Works

- The **Home Page** leads to a **Recipe Browser**.
- Recipes are shown as small preview cards.
- Clicking **"View Recipe"** opens a detailed view with full instructions and info.

Happy cooking!
